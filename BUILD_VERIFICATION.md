   - Changed from `build2\tbb` to `build\tbb` to match actual library structure

2. **Open3D Logging Compatibility**:
   - Fixed string logging calls to use `.c_str()` for C++ compatibility
   - Resolved compilation errors in both shell extensions

3. **COM Interface Casting**:
   - Applied proper `static_cast` fixes for Windows 11 compatibility
   - Enhanced error handling and resource management

- **TBB Deprecation Warnings**: Multiple warnings about deprecated TBB functionality (non-critical)
- **Data Conversion Warning**: C4244 warning about ULONGLONG to ULONG conversion in ModelThumbnail (non-critical)
- **PowerShell Warning**: Post-build scripts reference `pwsh.exe` which is not in PATH (non-critical)
